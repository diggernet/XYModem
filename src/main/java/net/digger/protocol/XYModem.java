		 * Chapter 7.2  Link Escape Encoding
		 * ZMODEM achieves data transparency by extending the 8 bit character set
		 * (256 codes) with escape sequences based on the ZMODEM data link escape
		 * character ZDLE.
		 * This and other constants are defined in the zmodem.h include file.
		 * Please note that constants with a leading 0 are octal constants in C.
		 * If a ZDLE character appears in binary data, it is prefixed with
		 * ZDLE, then sent as ZDLEE.
		 * The value for ZDLE is octal 030 (ASCII CAN).
		 * The receiving program decodes any sequence of ZDLE followed by a byte with
		 * bit 6 set and bit 5 reset (upper case letter, either parity) to the
		 * equivalent control character by inverting bit 6.  This allows the
		 * transmitter to escape any control character that cannot be sent by the
		 * communications medium.  In addition, the receiver recognizes escapes for
		 * 0177 and 0377 should these characters need to be escaped.
		 * ZMODEM software escapes ZDLE, 020, 0220, 021, 0221, 023, and 0223.  If
		 * preceded by 0100 or 0300 (@), 015 and 0215 are also escaped to protect the
		 * Telenet command escape CR-@-CR.  The receiver ignores 021, 0221, 023, and
		 * 0223 characters in the data stream.

		 * Chapter 8.1  Session Startup

		 * program from a possible command mode.  The "rz" followed by carriage

		 * monitor the data stream for ZDLE.  The following characters may be scanned
		 * for B00 indicating a ZRQINIT header, a command to download a command or
		 * data.
		 * The sending program awaits a command from the receiving program to start
